				<hr>
				<p>
				  Lightspeed to Nowhere is, at best, our feeble attempt at
				  internet engineering and world domination. Predominantly
				  though, Lightspeed to Nowhere is a webcomic created by two
				  enterprising gamers with updates every Monday, Wednesday, and
				  Friday. Like many other webcomics, we have comics (surprise!),
				  two occasionally witty creators, and an <a class="invert" href=
				  "http://www.lstncomic.com/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> to
				  keep you fed.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The comic itself follows the adventures of two space
				  pioneers looking for fame and fortune. When all hell breaks
				  loose aboard their starship; one capable of Faster
				  than Light travel, we find our protagonists are stuck
				  traveling nowhere, fast. Apart from our storyline, we enjoy
				  the freedom of being able to present relevant news and commentary
				  on current events, particularly gaming. We hope that we can
				  present a fresh, revealing perspective on some of the latest
				  topics to be found in the gaming universe.
				</p>
				<p>
				  About the creators, their names are Todd Curtis and Greg Hoyle.
				  Todd handles the art and design, and Greg handles the
				  writing and web programming. If in case, you'd like to
				  contact either of them, Todd can be reached at <a class="invert" href=
				  "mailto:todd@lstncomic.com">todd@lstncomic.com</a> and Greg
				  at <a class="invert" href=
				  "mailto:greg@lstncomic.com">greg@lstncomic.com.</a> They also
				  share <a class="invert" href=
				  "mailto:everyone@lstncomic.com">everyone@lstncomic.com</a>, which
				  is probably the best way to reach both of them.
				</p>
				<p>
				  "When can I expect new comics?" you might ask. Lightspeed to
				  Nowhere works on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule.
				  Greg works a pretty early morning and usually will have them
				  posted before noon eastern standard time, but he doesn't
				  guarantee anything.
				</p>
				<p>
				  If you want to share our comics with your friends, we'd
				  greatly appreciate it. It saves us the hassle of making friends,
				  but bear in mind these comics are ours. We take our work
				  seriously and have decided to protect it with a Creative Commons
				  license. You can't sell our work without our permission. You can
				  adapt our work however you see fit, but if you alter our
				  craftsmanship we require you to maintain our license. Finally, if
				  you do share our comics, please let people know who we are. We
				  love publicity, and unfortunately advertising is expensive. If
				  you have any questions, please contact Todd or Greg.
