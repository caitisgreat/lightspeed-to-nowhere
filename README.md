### Description

Lightspeed to Nowhere is, at best, our feeble attempt at
internet engineering and world domination. Predominantly
though, Lightspeed to Nowhere is a webcomic created by two
enterprising gamers with updates every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. Like many other webcomics, we have comics (surprise!),
two occasionally witty creators, and an RSS feed to
keep you fed.

The comic itself follows the adventures of two space
pioneers looking for fame and fortune. When all hell breaks
loose aboard their starship; one capable of Faster
than Light travel, we find our protagonists are stuck
traveling nowhere, fast. Apart from our storyline, we enjoy
the freedom of being able to present relevant news and commentary
on current events, particularly gaming. We hope that we can
present a fresh, revealing perspective on some of the latest
topics to be found in the gaming universe.

"When can I expect new comics?" you might ask. Lightspeed to
Nowhere works on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule.

If you want to share our comics with your friends, we'd
greatly appreciate it. It saves us the hassle of making friends,
